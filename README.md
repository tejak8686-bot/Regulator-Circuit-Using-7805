# Regulator-Circuit-Using-7805
A Regulator Circuit using the 7805 voltage regulator is a simple and commonly used setup to convert an unregulated DC voltage (e.g., 9V or 12V) into a regulated 5V DC output. The 7805 is a linear voltage regulator that outputs a steady +5V, ideal for powering logic circuits like Arduino, sensors, etc.
